## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

## Learning Log

Update this section each week with observations, breakthroughs, and questions.
​
## Week : The Setup
​
### What I Learned
Strings, Booleans, Variables, Reassigning values, console.log​
​
### What Was Hard
Understanding, or trying to understand how this information could be utilized to create interactive effects in code. ​
​
### How I Used AI
I used AI to understand the code that I was copying. OpenAI helped me realize what some of the interactions meant and why I was doing them in the console. ​
​
### What's Still Unclear
I don't understand what communication with the console on webpages is for, and how it is relavent in design. I don't understand how java helps to audit code, and why I would ever use it in that way.​

### Week 1: ### What I Learned
I learned how to use java to switch variable modes. ​
​
### What Was Hard
It was hard to motivate myself to learn as I am succumbing to senioritis. I don't understand javascript. I want AI to do it for me.​
​
### How I Used AI
I used AI everytime I was stuck with questions on the HTML workshop​
​
### What's Still Unclear
It is unclear why naming conventions are so important in the code​
​

# Learning Log
​
## Week 2
​
### What I Learned
I learned how to define variables and modes in figma and transfer them to code​
​
### What Was Hard
It was hard to figure out naming conventions at first, but I got the hang of it. ​
​
### How I Used AI
I used AI to help organize and clean up my code, and to provide feedback on naming conventions​
​
### What's Still Unclear
I don't know how to code JS by myself, and im unsure if i will get there, but I am starting to understand it better.​
​
​
## Week 3
​
### What I Learned
Design tokens, state vs appearance, system preference, persistence. Learned how to add a button that toggles theme data, how to save user preference, and how to load user preference as a default upon re-entry to the webpage
​
​
### What Was Hard
It was hard to get the code right. Took trial and error. ​
​
### How I Used AI
I used AI to help look over my code and help me find errors while implementing the new element. ​
​
### What's Still Unclear
I am understanding what we are learning this week. I feel good about dataset java regarding theme right now. I don't full understand the code, ie the variable naming conventions, but I understand where to apply it and what it does. ​
