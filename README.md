## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

## Learning Log

Update this section each week with observations, breakthroughs, and questions.
​
## Week : The Setup
​
### What I Learned
Strings, Booleans, Variables, Reassigning values, console.log​
​
### What Was Hard
Understanding, or trying to understand how this information could be utilized to create interactive effects in code. ​
​
### How I Used AI
I used AI to understand the code that I was copying. OpenAI helped me realize what some of the interactions meant and why I was doing them in the console. ​
​
### What's Still Unclear
I don't understand what communication with the console on webpages is for, and how it is relavent in design. I don't understand how java helps to audit code, and why I would ever use it in that way.​
